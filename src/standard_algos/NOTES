Three methods

1. Include exclude - Use for combinations, subsets etc.
2. Use bit method for this as well. Just we can ot use more than 64 elements in set. But this method is fast.

3. Permute a string. Check program for it.
4. If we use for-loop-recusion method instead then it will have duplicate characters. Use this method in e.g. phonebook where it is allowed. Also consider this method when you know the bounds.
